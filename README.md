Hi! Thank you for being here!

First of all, the file you will find here will always be the latest version, but be careful, you will have to redownload it in case of an update.

Anyway, let's move on to how to install this thing on your PC.
1. Download the "carrot" file;
2. Open the terminal and, by typing `sudo <the name of your file manager>` and entering the password of your choice, enter the `/usr/bin` directory;
3. Paste the "carrot" file there, and you're done!

Once this is done, type `carrot -help` in the terminal, and it should list the commands you can do with Carrotbash. Have fun!
