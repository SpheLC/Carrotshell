Hi! Thank you for being here!
# What is Carrotshell
`Carrotchell` is a program written in Bash that has to be called via the Linux terminal with the `carrot` command, and it uses to make the approach between a Linux Operating System and a non-expert user easier. Additionally, it has some shortcuts for running programs (such as C, C++, and Rust) with just one command.

# Install
Anyway, let's move on to how to install this thing on your PC.
1. Download the "carrot" file;
2. Open the terminal and, by typing `sudo <the name of your file manager>` and entering the sudo password (or your computer password, if you made them the same), enter the `/usr/bin` directory;
3. Paste the "carrot" file there, and you're done!

Once this is done, type `carrot -help` in the terminal, and it should list the commands you can do with Carrotshell. Have fun!
