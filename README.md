Hi! Thank you for being here!

# Install
Anyway, let's move on to how to install this thing on your PC.
1. Download the "carrot" file;
2. Open the terminal and, by typing `sudo <the name of your file manager>` and entering the sudo password (or your computer password, if you made them the same), enter the `/usr/bin` directory;
3. Paste the "carrot" file there, and you're done!

Once this is done, type `carrot -help` in the terminal, and it should list the commands you can do with Carrotshell. Have fun!
